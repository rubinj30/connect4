Goals:
1) build a 2 person game on the command line
2) build a 2 person game with a front end (hosted somewhere)
3) build an AI to play against

For the final version, I plan on building out the game with Typescript/React on the front-end and Rails on the back-end. The command-line version will be a node.js app, so some of the functions can be re-used in version 2. 

To play the CLI version: 
1) navigate to the `cli-version` directory
2) `npm install` dependencies
3) `npm start` or `node index.js` to start the game
4) player 1 ('B' for Black) and player 2 ('R' for red) will alternate picking columns to drop game pieces in
